HW 1 Assessment

For this assignment I opted to make my code as simple as possible, conceptually. I am sure if it affects the efficiency of my program negatively but it made things more conceptually simple for me as this is the first  exposure I have had to an ML/functional programming language. I didn’t really change my approach to this at any point during the assignment because I wanted to keep my functions simple, and my method of keeping it simple was using if/then/else statements when possible as they felt more comfortable to use rather than attempting a more elegant solution. Additionally, my only goal was to get each component of the assignment to function properly rather than make it fancy. I had to reject many approaches because they simply were not feasible in OCaml, or at least given my knowledge of it. The best approach was to create many smaller “helper” functions to do the heavy lifting of the other functions. It allowed me to keep track of the reachable terminal and nonterminal aspects of a given grammar. I wish I would have been able to use the computed fixed point and equals_set functions as hinted to in the assignment specs but unfortunately I was not able to find a way to use them in my approach. However, honestly I feel like it is more important that my program functions as expected, passes edge cases, passes the sample tests, then uses a hinted method.
